Answer: - At intersections without traffic signals, pedestrians have the right of way if they are in marked crosswalks or in unmarked crosswalks formed by imaginary lines extending across the streets.
- When crossing with a green signal, pedestrians have the right of way over all vehicles, including those turning across the paths of the pedestrians.
- If a traffic signal changes to yellow or red while a pedestrian remains in the street, you must allow the pedestrian to complete the crossing safely.

Answer: When approached by an emergency vehicle, you should move to the right edge or curb of the road and stop completely. Remain stopped until the emergency vehicle has passed, or until you are directed to move by a peace officer. Never follow an emergency fire vehicle within 150 metres and never drive or park within 150 metres of an emergency vehicle that has stopped to investigate a collision or to give assistance.
